1. Repositories :
A repository (or repo) is a storage space where your project files and their history are kept. There are two types of repositories in Git:
Local Repository: A copy of the project on your local machine.
Remote Repository: A version of the project hosted on a server, often on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

2. Commits
A commit is a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique identifier (hash) and includes a message describing the changes made. Commits allow you to track and review the history of your project.

3. Branches
A branch is a separate line of development. The default branch is called main or master. You can create new branches to work on features or fixes independently. Once the work is complete, the branch can be merged back into the main branch.

4. Merging
Merging is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another. It allows you to combine the work done in different branches and resolve any conflicts that arise.

6. Pull and Push
Pull: Fetches updates from the remote repository and integrates them into your local repository.
Push: Sends your local changes to the remote repository, making them available to others.
