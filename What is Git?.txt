What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that allows developers to track changes in their codebase, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of their projects efficiently

Git was developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for Linux kernel development.
Git is 2.45.1 is the Lastest Verions of GIT, released on May 2024.

Why Use Git?
Version Control: Git helps in tracking changes, allowing you to revert to previous states if something goes wrong.
Collaboration: It enables multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other’s work.
Backup: Your entire project history is saved in a Git repository, providing a backup of all versions.
Branching and Merging: Git’s branching model allows you to experiment with new features or bug fixes independently from the main project.
Open Source Projects: Most open source projects use Git for version control. Learning Git allows you to contribute to these projects.
Industry Standard: Git is widely used in the software industry, making it an essential skill for developers.

Working with Git
Initializing a Repository: When you initialize a folder with Git, it becomes a repository. Git logs all changes made to a hidden folder within that repository.
Staging Changes: Git marks modified files as “staged.” Staging prepares changes for a snapshot you want to keep.
Committing Changes: Once staged changes are satisfactory, commit them. Git maintains a complete record of each commit.

What is Github?
GitHub, a hosting service for Git repositories, allows you to access and download projects from any computer. Here’s what you can do with GitHub:

Store Repositories: GitHub hosts your repositories.
Collaborate: Work with other developers from any location.
Version Control: Manage collaborative workflows using Git and GitHub.
